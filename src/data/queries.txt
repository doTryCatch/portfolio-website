Definition and Usage The download attribute specifies that the target (the file specified in the href attribute) will be downloaded when a user clicks on the hyperlink.  The optional value of the download attribute will be the new name of the file after it is downloaded. There are no restrictions on allowed values, and the browser will automatically detect the correct file extension and add it to the file (.img, .pdf, .txt, .html, etc.).  If the value is omitted, the original filename is used.
